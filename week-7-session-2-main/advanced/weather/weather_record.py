# The class WeatherRecord represents a set of
# measurements made by a weather station at a particular point in time




# define a WeatherRecord class with the following fields:
# (1) local_date_time - representing the time the data were recorded
# (2) wind_speed - a float value representing the wind speed
# (3) temperature - a float representing the temperature
# (4) solar_irradiance - a float representing solar irradiance
# (5) humidity - a float representing humidty





# the WeatherRecord class has the following methods:
# (1) __init__ - initialise the fields
# (2) __str__ - returns a string representation of the weather record in the 
#     format "data time,wind_speed,temperature,solar_irradiance,humidity",
#     e.g., 23/03/2011 15:00,2.55,17.89,417.4,34.64
